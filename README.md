# MovieMate Telegram Bot

**MovieMateBot** is a Telegram bot designed to simplify movie planning and tracking for pairs of users. It allows two users to create a shared movie list, categorized as "Planned" or "Watched," add movies, view lists, and get random movie suggestions from their planned list. Users connect via an invite code and interact with a unified dataset stored in Supabase.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Name**: MovieMateBot
- **Goal**: Streamline movie watching organization for pairs
- **Platform**: Telegram bot
- **Data Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Language**: Python
- **Description**: Users can link with a partner using an invite code, manage a shared movie list, and receive random movie recommendations from their planned list.

## 👣 User Workflow

### 🧍 User A
1. Start the bot with `/start`.
2. Generate an invite code using `/invite` (e.g., `INV-893421`).
3. Share the invite code with User B.

### 🧍‍♂️ User B
1. Start the bot with `/start`.
2. Join the pair by sending `/join INV-893421`.

### 🎉 Once Paired
- Both users can add movies to their shared list.
- View movies in either the "Planned" or "Watched" categories.
- Get random movie suggestions from the "Planned" list.
- Edit or delete movies, or change their category, all via button-based menus.
- All changes are instantly synchronized for both users.

## 🆕 Advanced Features

- **Full button-based interface**: All actions (add, edit, delete, change category, random pick) are available via Telegram buttons and menus — no need to remember commands.
- **Edit movie title and category**: Change both the name and the category (planned/loved) of any movie via interactive inline menus.
- **Delete with confirmation**: Deleting a movie always asks for confirmation via Yes/No buttons.
- **Unified edit menu**: The "Edit Movies" menu allows you to:
  - Edit movie title (choose a movie, then enter a new name)
  - Change movie category (choose a movie, then select category)
  - Delete a movie (choose a movie, then confirm)
- **Robust error handling**: All user actions and errors are logged; the bot provides clear feedback for every operation.
- **Partner-aware**: All lists and actions are always synchronized between you and your paired user.

## 📝 Example Usage (Button Flow)

1. Open the main menu and tap "✏️ Edit Movies" (or use `/editdeletemenu`).
2. See your full movie list and choose:
   - "✏️ Edit Title" — select a movie, then enter a new title.
   - "🗂️ Edit Category" — select a movie, then pick Planned/Loved.
   - "🗑️ Delete" — select a movie, then confirm deletion.
3. All changes are instantly reflected for both you and your partner.
4. Use the "🎲 Random Movie" button to get a random suggestion from your "Planned" list.
5. Use the "📜 List Movies" button to view your movies in either category.
6. Use the "🔗 Partner Status" button to check if you're paired with someone.
7. Use the "🔗 Unlink" button to disconnect from your partner.

- `users.partner_id`: Self-referential foreign key for pairing users.
- `movies.user_id`: Links movies to their owner.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValliKaz/MovieMatebot.git
cd MovieMateBot
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root, add your bot token and since I'm using Supabase, add your Supabase URL and key:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key_here
```

## Running the Bot

```bash
